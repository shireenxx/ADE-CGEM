# Contextualized Graph Embeddings for Adverse Drug Event Detection (CGEM)
This repo is for reproducing the results of paper Contextualized Graph Embeddings for Adverse Drug Event Detection.
## Introduction
This paper investigates contextualized language models and heterogeneous graph representations. 
It builds a contextualized graph embedding model for adverse drug event detection. 
We employ different convolutional graph neural networks and pre-trained contextualized embeddings as the building blocks. 
Experimental results show that our methods can improve the performance by comparing recent ADE detection models, suggesting that a text graph can capture causal relationships and dependency between different entities in a document.
